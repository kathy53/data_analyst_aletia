# data_analyst_aletia
In this repository, several codes are shown. Each of them represents a stage in the data-analyst roadmap. There are five modules.
In the first one, Excel was used for data analysis. During the second module, we studied RDBM and SQL. EDA using Python and calculus of distributions were part of the
third module. The next stands for data cleaning, transformation, normalization &standarization, feature engineering, and PCA. Finally, performed linear regression, 
K-means, and over & underfitting.
